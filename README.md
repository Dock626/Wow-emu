# Wow-Emu

Wow-Emu is a project aiming to replicate the basic mechanics of *World of Warcraft* in the **Godot engine**. The primary goal is to create a functional and enjoyable prototype while improving game development skills.  

## Implemented Features

- **Targeting System** – Select a player or NPC with the right mouse button.  
- **Spellcasting System** – Cast spells on targets or the ground, with or without projectiles.  
- **Spell Builder** – Easily create spells using the `SpellDatabase` with a builder pattern.  
- **Proc System** – Set a percentage chance for instant spell casts instead of their normal cast time.  
- **Core Mechanics** – Character movement, health display, and other fundamental RPG elements.  

## Current Plans  

- Develop a fully functional class with a fun ability rotation.  
- Create an encounter or implement *Vampire Survivors*-style enemy logic for a showcase.  
- Implement multiplayer synchronization.  

## Future Plans  

- Develop an in-game encounter editor for creating raid bosses and enemies.  
- Create a dungeon creator.  
- Implement a character creator.  
- Optimize and rewrite parts of the game in C#/C++ where necessary.  

## Personal Goals  

- Learn game development, primarily coding, with the aim of finding a programming job.  
- Build a game that can be played with friends without requiring a purchase.
