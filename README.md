# Wow-Emu

Wow-Emu is a project aiming to replicate the basic mechanics of *World of Warcraft* in the **Godot engine**. The primary goal is to create a functional and enjoyable prototype while improving game development skills.  

## Implemented Features

- **Targeting System** – Select a player or NPC with the right mouse button or use Tab targeting from WoW.
- **Spellcasting System** – Cast spells on targets or the ground, with or without projectiles.  
- **Spell Builder** – Easily create spells using the `SpellDatabase` with a builder pattern.  
- **Proc System** – Set a percentage chance for instant spell casts instead of their normal cast time.  
- **Core Mechanics** – Character movement, health display, and other fundamental RPG elements.  
- **Mage Class** - Play as a mage and see how the game works so far.
- **Spellbook** - Press P to have fun with buttons, you can move around your binds etc.

## Current Plans and Issues

- Implement full multiplayer synchronization.
- Implement line of sight (LoS)
- Spells should have limited cast range
- More interesting enemies / better encounter
- Tab targeting should only take enemies on the screen to consideration
- Rewrite buffs, they are a little scuffed

## Future Plans  

- Develop an in-game encounter editor for creating raid bosses and enemies.  
- Make a dungeon creator.  
- Implement a character creator.  
- Optimize and rewrite parts of the game in C#/C++ where necessary.  

## Personal Goals  

- Learn game development, primarily coding, with the aim of finding a programming job.  
- Build a game that can be played with friends without requiring a purchase.
